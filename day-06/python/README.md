# Day 6 #

## Part 1 ##

A chance to use a nice little recursive algorithm and a dict.

To test, run `python3 part1.py test-input.txt` and verify the output is `42`.

For the solution, run `python3 part1.py input.txt`.

## Part 2 ##

Also recursion and a dictionary!
This time, track the path from your destination to the center of the system,
and the path from your ship to the center of the system.
Somewhere the paths will meet, and compute that distance.

To test, run `python3 part2.py test-input-2.txt` and verify the output is `4`.

For the solution, run `python3 part2.py input.txt`.
