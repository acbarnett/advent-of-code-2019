# Day 02 Python Solution #

## Running the tests ##

For day 2, let's add some unit tests to this business!
Using python's `unittest` module, this is very easy.

To run the tests, just call `python3 intcode_lib_test.py`

These tests run through the test cases supplied in the README for part 1 of today's challenge.

## Solving part 1 ##

We just need to get the value in the first position.
The file `part1.py` has the solution for this.

Invoke it with `python3 part1.py` and you should be good to go!
